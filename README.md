# AI-Shark  

This project is a fork of CPS.
We decided that we were going to make an affordable and amazing underwater drone that combines the features of Hydrus and CPS.

AI-Shark was started by First Lego League Team 60958, whose members are Stone & Cole Cameron, Leikh & Ronin Gadhia, Owen Lew, Adam Saxanov, David Tang, Binken Uritani. 

It is about creating a functional product of a innovative submarine, primarily with live streaming from camera in the drone. 
Project is based on 3D printing process, which allows developing various solutions for the form of a drone.

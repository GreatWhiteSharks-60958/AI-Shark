This project is a fork of CPS.
We decided that we were going to make an affordable and amazing underwater drone that combines the features of Hydrus and CPS.

AI-Shark was started by First Lego League Team 60958, whose members are Stone & Cole Cameron, Leikh & Ronin Gadhia, Owen Lew, Adam Saxanov, David Tang, Binken Uritani. 

It is about creating a functional product of a innovative submarine, primarily with live streaming from camera in the drone and the ability to map things and record data. 
This project is based on 3D printing process, which allows you to develop various solutions for different problems.
